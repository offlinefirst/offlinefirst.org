  <h2>
    The Schedule
  </h2>
 
  <h3>A quick note on travel arrangements</h3>
  <p>When booking your travel, please be careful to allow sufficient driving time to our remote destination. You should plan to <i>arrive between 4:00 - 6:30pm on Friday</i> and <i>depart around 11:00am on Monday</i>. (Official discussions end by 7:00pm on Sunday if you <i>must</i> leave us early, but we really hope you'll stick around through Monday breakfast.)</p>
  <p>The airports nearest to the ranch are:<br>
       &#183; San Luis Obispo (SBP) - Approximately 1 hour<br>
       &#183; Los Angeles (LAX) - Approximately 3 - 4.5 hours depending on traffic<br>
       &#183; San Francisco (SFO) - Approximately 4.5 hours, but an easier drive than from LA</p>
 
  <h3>The formal(ish) schedule</h3>
  <p>Offline Camp is a mix of formal discussion and informal networking and relaxation, and we sometimes make schedule adjustments on site to adapt to whatever awesomeness ensues. That said, here's a sneak peek at our plan for the weekend. (Don't worry, there are also breaks mixed in between these activities!)</p>
